/**
 * A bridge for inter-application communication among message queues.
 * By connecting this bridge to a message queue (by use of [connect]),
 * the messages can be sent to, or received from another applications,
 * as long as they also connect to a bridge with the same name.
   *
 * Message queues connecting the same bridge are considered
 * as the same group. They are distinquished by [name].
 *
 * The implementation is based on the browser's cross-window messaging.
 * It means the applications can reside even on different browser windows.
 *
 * Notice: the message will be converted to a JSON string, so
 * the message must be null, double, String, bool, list (recursively)
 * and map (recursively). Also notice that num will be converted to
 * double.
