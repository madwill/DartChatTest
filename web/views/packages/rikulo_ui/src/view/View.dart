/**
 * A view represents the basic building block for user interface.
 * A view occupies a rectangular area on the screen and the
 * interfaces for managing the content and event handling in the area.
 *
 * ##Events
 *
 * + `layout`: an instance of [LayoutEvent] indicates the layout of this view
 * has been handled.
 * + `prelayout`: an instance of [LayoutEvent] indicates the layout of this view
 * will be handled.
 * + `mount`: an instance of [ViewEvent] indicates this view has been
 * added to the document.
 * + `unmount`: an instance of [ViewEvent] indicates this view will be
 * removed from the document.
 *
 * ##Default CSS classes
 *
 * Default [classes]: "v-$className"
 * (note: "v-" is actually [viewConfig.classPrefix])
 *
 * ##ID Space
 *
 * If a view implements [IDSpace], it and its descendants are considered
 * as a ID space. And, the topmost view is the owner.
 * All IDs in the given ID space must be unique.
 * On the other hand, views in different ID spaces can have the same ID.
 *
 * Implementing [IDSpace] is straightforward:
 *
 *     class MyIDSpace extends View implements IDSpace {
 *       final Map<String, View> fellows = new HashMap();
 *     }
 *
 * ##See Also

   * linear layout and width has been changed, then its sibling views at the right
