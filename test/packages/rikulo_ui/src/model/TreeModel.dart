/**
 * A data model representing a tree of data.
 * Each node of the tree can be anything and represented with the generic type, `T`.
 *
 * Instead of implementing this interface from scratch, it is suggested:
 *
 * 1. Use [DefaultTreeModel] if you'd like to represent the tree with a tree of [TreeNode].
 * In other words, each node of the tree is represented with an instance of [TreeNode], and
 * the data can be retrieved by [TreeNode.data].
 * 2. Extends from [AbstractTreeModel]. [AbstractTreeModel] provides the implementation
 * of handling of data listeners, maintaining the open states and the selection.
 *
 * ##How Data Retrieved
 *
 * To retrieve the data in the data model,
 *
 * 1. [root] is called first to retrieve the root data
 * 2. [isLeaf] is called to examine if the data (aka., the node) is a leaf node
 * 3. If it is not a leaf, [getChildCount] is called to retrieve the number of children
 * 4. Then, [getChild] is called to retrieve each child
 * 5. Repeat  2-4
 *
 * ##Path
 *
 * A node of the tree model can be presented by an integer array called `path`.
 * For example, [0, 2, 1] represents a node at the third level (excluding root) since
 * there are three elements. Furthermore, it is the root's the first child's
 * the third child's second child. YOu can retrieve it as follows
 *
 *     model.getChildAt([0, 2, 1]);
 *
 * [TreeModel] doesn't not provide API to retrieve the path of a given node
 * (since sometimes it is hard to get). Thus, the view that supports [TreeModel]
 * shall store the path, if necessary, when rendering.
 *
 * On the other hand, [DefaultTreeModel] and [TreeNode] do
 * provide `getPath()` to retrieve the path of any given node.
 *
 * ##SelectionModel
 *
 * If you'd like to use [TreeModel] with a UI object that allows the user to select the data,
 * such as [DropDownList]. You have to implement [SelectionModel].
 * Both [DefaultTreeModel] and [AbstractTreeModel] implements it, so you need to implement
 * it only if you implement [TreeModel] from scratch.
 *
 * ##OpensModel
 *
 * A tree model maintains a list of opened nodes ([OpensModel]). If a tree node matches
 * one of the open nodes, the tree node will be opened, i.e., the child views
 * will be visible to the user.

 * ##Big Tree
 *

 * instantiation of a class is delayed until the point just before the instance is actually used.
 *
 * To implement Lazy Loading, you can implement a tree node by extending [DefaultTreeNode]
 * and then override [DefaultTreeNode.loadLazily_] to return the initial child nodes.
