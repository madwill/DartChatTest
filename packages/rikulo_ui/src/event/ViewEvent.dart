/**
 * A view event.
 * The event received by [View]'s event listener must be an instance of this class.
 *
 * Notice that the event will bubble up through the hierarchy of views. It
 * is convenient if you'd like to handle the events of children. For example,
 * you can handle the click event for all child buttons as follows:
 *
 *     view.on.click((event) {
 *       switch (event.target.id) { //target is the view firing the event
 *         case "OK": //submit
 *         case "Cancel": //...
 *       }
 *     });
 *
 * Sometimes it might cause a problem. For example, [LayoutEvent] will be sent
 * to every views and then bubbles up. It means your `layout` listener usually
 * has to filter events not belonging to the target view. It can be done easily
 * by use `event.target == event.currentTarget'. For example,
 *
 *     view.on.layout((event) {
 *       if (event.target == event.currentTarget) {
 *          //handle event.target
 *       }
 *     })
